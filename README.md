# üìò JavaScript Practice Project

This repository contains my JavaScript practice programs. It includes **closure functions**, **two types of calculators**, a **salary slip generator**, and a **recursive function** example. Each program is written in plain **JavaScript**, with simple UI for calculators and salary slip.

## üöÄ Project Contents

### üîπ 1. Closure Function
- Demonstrates how closures work in JavaScript.  
- Example: A function that remembers variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

### üîπ 2. Calculator 1 (Switch Case Based)
- A **menu-driven calculator** where the user enters two values and selects an operation by choice number.  
- Operations included:  
  1. Addition  
  2. Subtraction  
  3. Multiplication  
  4. Division  
- Uses **switch case** in JavaScript.  
- Built with **Bootstrap** UI + JavaScript logic.

### üîπ 3. Calculator 2 (Button Based)
- A **UI-based calculator** where the user enters two numbers and clicks a button (`+`, `-`, `√ó`, `√∑`).  
- The result is displayed instantly in the "Answer" field.  
- Uses **separate functions** for each operation (`sum`, `sub`, `multi`, `div`).  
- Built with **Bootstrap** for styling and JavaScript for logic.

### üîπ 4. Salary Slip Generator (with Switch Case & UI)
- Takes **user input** (like name, basic salary, allowances, deductions, etc.) using a form UI.  
- Uses a **switch case** to process salary details.  
- Outputs all the employee information + salary breakdown.
